# ABOUT THE PROJECT
---
Summer Holidays are here and you have not planned where to spend your holidays ?! Well, fear not Destinify is here and is ready to help you choose your place to spend your vacations awesomely.  

#What it does

We are trying to solve the problem of choosing a city to spend our vacations. This is done by Sentiment Analysis done on twitter data for famous cities. It calculates which city should be weighted more and which is better place to spend our vacations.
## What else?
	We are also solving problem for visually impaired and disabled person which are not able to use it. This is done by text to speech api and speech to text api of HP so that the person can interact with the user.
